# Panda3D-P3D-Player
Standalone player applicaion that plays .p3d files created with the old Panda3D deployment system. Created with the intent of assting in the software preservation of old Panda3D games. 

This application is not intended to be run with the latest version of Panda3D (this may or may not work), rather it is inteneded to be built with the old Panda3D runtime. This is a difficult task due to SSL since the certs have expired for the old runtime. You can download a binary on the releases page.
